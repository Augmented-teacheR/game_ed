# Idea: 

The Augmented TeacheR is an app that allows users to interact with the subject through expirements that are done in real-time and supports multi-users.


# Flow: 

The app starts with the main menu where the user can fiddle with the settings or play.
Once the play button is pressed the user is moved to the level selection screen where each level is unlocked upon completion of the previous one. Gradually increasing the depth of understanding of the concept. 

During the level present in the prototype the users can scan the QR codes in order to spawn the expirement environment.
The user needs to adjust the parameters of the experiment correctly in order to pass the level. 

The prototype supports multiple users with the voting system where each user gets a vote for setting the parameters. 

Upon failing or succeeding the level a prompt will appear with the suitable options.


# Design: 
The welcome screen consists of three buttons - start the game, settings and exit. 
Clicking on "start the game" takes the user to a page with a choice of levels (it is further assumed that in addition to the choice of levels it will also be possible to choose a subject to study, e.g. chemistry, biology, mathematics etc.). 
Both the main menu and the level selection are designed in a simple way, with square buttons on a green background. Everything is in bright colours and attractive cartoon-style shapes, as this is a children's game aimed at 11-year-olds in school. 
The design is simple in order to be attractive and easy for the user. For the prototype the level consists of touristic places from both Egypt and Germany with a road and a train track where the user needs to adjust the speed of the car in order to avoid crashing into the train.
